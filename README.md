# Mixed Messages Project

---

This is collaborative MadLib style JavaScript project to create randomly-generated messages.

There is a potential of this project to become published on a web-page to allow general interaction using HTML & CSS.

---

The goal is to have a madlib-style generator with an option for user input and a generate/refresh button for the output, so the page doesn't have to be refreshed each time the code is run.
